        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will walk through how to use [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) with Google's [Gemini models](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) to query information from a document. LlamaIndex is a powerful framework for building applications with large language models over your data. Gemini models are state-of-the-art language models from Google AI. By combining these tools, we can create intelligent applications that can understand and answer questions based on your documents.\n",
